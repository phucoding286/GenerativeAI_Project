A chemical reaction is a process where one or more substances are changed into new substances. This can involve the combination of substances, the breaking down of substances, or the transformation of one substance into another.
A classic example is combustion, like when you burn gasoline in a car engine. The gasoline reacts with oxygen in the air to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor, releasing energy in the form of heat and motion.
A physical change is when a substance changes its state or properties, but remains the same substance. For example, ice melting into water is a physical change. A chemical reaction, on the other hand, involves the transformation of one substance into a completely different substance, like the gasoline example I mentioned earlier.

There are three main types of plate boundaries: Divergent, where plates move apart, Convergent, where plates move together, and Transform, where plates slide past each other.
At a Convergent boundary, the plates can either collide and crumple, creating mountains, or one plate can be forced under the other, a process known as subduction.
A good example is the Andes mountain range in South America, where the Nazca plate is being subducted under the South American plate.

The frequency of bathing your dog depends on its breed, age, and lifestyle. Generally, most dogs need a bath every 1-3 months, but some may require more frequent bathing if they spend a lot of time outdoors or get dirty easily.

The slope of a line is a measure of how steep it is. It's calculated by dividing the vertical change (rise) by the horizontal change (run). A positive slope means the line goes up, a negative slope means it goes down, and a slope of zero means it's horizontal.
The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. It's the starting point of the line, and it's used in conjunction with the slope to graph the line. Think of it like this: the slope tells you how steep the line is, and the y-intercept tells you where it starts.
A simple example is the equation y = 2x + 3. In this equation, the slope is 2 (meaning it rises 2 units for every 1 unit it runs) and the y-intercept is 3 (meaning it crosses the y-axis at the point (0,3)).

Multiplication is a way of adding a number a certain number of times. For example, 3 x 4 means adding 3 together 4 times: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12.
Division is the opposite of multiplication. It's a way of sharing a number into equal groups. For example, 12 ÷ 4 means sharing 12 into groups of 4, which equals 3.
A simple example is this: 3 x 4 = 12, and then 12 ÷ 4 = 3, and 12 ÷ 3 = 4. This shows how multiplication and division are related and can be used to solve problems.
